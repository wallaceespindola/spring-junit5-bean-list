This project was generated by the Java 11 and JUnit 5 archetype.

Spring feature was added for the dependency injection tests.

This project has the goal of testing different Spring contexts.

1) By annotation and config class
2) By XML file config for beans

Another goal is to test the auto-detection of a list of beans of a given type automatically for injection.
Later, when a new bean of same type is added, it should be automatically detected and injected.
